wiki-crawler
============

Gathers and analyzes data from the [Internet Safety Wiki](http://www.internetsafetyproject.org/wiki/internet-safety-wiki).


This project has no documentation whatsoever. I just don't feel like writing it for something that will likely never be used again. **If you would like to use this project to continue to improve the Internet Safety Wiki**, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/colindt/wiki-crawler/issues) and I'll write some documentation or clean up the code or something so you can have it.
