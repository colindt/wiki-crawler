wiki-crawler
============

Gathers and analyzes data from the [Internet Safety Wiki](http://www.internetsafetyproject.org/wiki/internet-safety-wiki).

These scripts were used to help generate the following pages:
* [List of Articles with no Outgoing Wiki Links](http://www.internetsafetyproject.org/node/11619)
* [List of Articles with no Incoming Wiki Links](http://www.internetsafetyproject.org/node/11620)
* [List of Articles Unreachable from the Main Page (A-J)](http://www.internetsafetyproject.org/node/11627)
* [List of Articles Unreachable from the Main Page (K-Z)](http://www.internetsafetyproject.org/node/11628)

This project has no documentation whatsoever. I just don't feel like writing it for something that will likely never be used again. **If you would like to use this project to continue to improve the Internet Safety Wiki**, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/colindt/wiki-crawler/issues) and I'll write some documentation or clean up the code or something so you can have it.
